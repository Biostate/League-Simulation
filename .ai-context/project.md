# Insider One Champions League

In this project, we expect you to complete a simulation. In this simulation, there will be a group of football teams, and the simulation will show match results and the league table. Your task is to estimate the final league table.

## League Rules

- There will be four teams in the league (if you wish, you can choose teams that have different strengths, and you can determine the results of the matches depending on the strengths of these selected teams).
- Other rules in the league (scoring, points, goal difference, etc.) will be the same as the rules of the Premier League.

Moving forward, both the point scores and the results of the matches will be represented by this screen. In addition, after the 4th week, your estimation will also be represented on this screen.
