1. **What are Football Rules?**
    Three points for a win is a standard used in many sports leagues and group
    tournaments, especially in association football, in which three (rather than two) points
    are awarded to the team winning a match, with no points awarded to the losing team.
    If the game is drawn, each team receives one point. The system places additional
    value on wins compared to draws such that teams with a higher number of wins may
    rank higher in tables than teams with a lower number of wins but more draws.Source
2. **What is a league?**
    The tournament proper begins with a group stage of 32 teams, divided into eight
    groups of four. Seeding is used whilst making the draw for this stage, whilst teams
    from the same nation may not be drawn into groups together. Each team plays six
    group stage games, meeting the other three teams in its group home and away in a
    round-robin format.Source
**3. What is a champions league?**
    The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL) is an annual club football
    competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and
    contested by top-division European clubs, deciding the competition winners through
    a round robin group stage to qualify for a double-legged knockout format, and a
    single leg final. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and
    the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national
    league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national
    associations.Source
**4. What is a fixture?**
    The teams will be split into four seeding pots. Pot 1 will consist of the holders, the
    UEFA Europa League winners and the champions of the six highest-ranked nations
    who did not qualify via one of the 2020/21 continental titles; Pots 2 to 4 will be
    determined by the club coefficient rankings.
    No team can play a side from their own association. Any other restrictions will be
    announced ahead of the draw ceremony.
    In the case of associations with two representatives, clubs will be paired in order to
    split their matches between Tuesdays and Wednesdays. In the case of associations
    with four (or more) representatives, two pairings will be made.Source
**5. What exactly do you want from the simulation?**
    It needs to simulate the matches week by week fromthe fixture created before.
    When two teams play matches against each other, let's say team A has 100 team
    power and team B has 10 team power, in this case in real-world team B can't win a
    match against team A, simulation also should consider the team power. But, that's
    not mean team B never can win a match, it might happen as well but with a really
    small chance
**6. Which team will be the winner on what?**
    A team playing a match must have a power point of its own. With this point, it should
    win according to its superiority against the other team, depending on whether it is
    home or away, supporter strength, goalkeeper factor and other factors that you will
    determine yourself. Here, if you want, you can gain superiority according to the
    number of goals scored by the teams, or you can make direct score predictions. But
    what you need to pay attention to is that the results are close to the truth.
**7. Should the design be the same?**
    No
**8. How does prediction work?**
    When entering the last 3 weeks during the group matches, we want the
    championship rates of the teams to be estimated. You are expected to create a
    certain championship percentage by taking into account the remaining matches of
    the teams, either directly taking into account the points earned at that time, or by
    adding the remaining matches of the teams along with these points to this forecasting
    system. For example, there are 2 weeks left of the group matches and 1 team is
    ahead by 9 points. In this case, the championship percentage of that team will be
    100% and the others will decrease to 0% or there is 1 week left until the end of the
    group matches and the points of the teams in the first two rows of the group will be
    equal and the last match will be played against each other. Here, estimates such as
    50%, 50% or 65%, 35% can be made based on the goals they have scored in their
    past matches or the teams they have beaten. This part depends on the estimation
    algorithm you will write.
